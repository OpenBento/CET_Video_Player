CET_Video_Player
================

Video Player with 3 options - JWplayer, Brightcove, YouTube. Mobile-ready, but not 100% responsive.
When sharing videos on a page, we have come across the need for multiple video player options. 
Instead of having 3 different snippets for each player, I've combined them into one snippet.
It is mostly responsive, save for the Brightcove player that only resizes to point. I'm still tweaking that. 
You will need to put in the src for your JWPlayer cloud key. The JWPlayer utilizes the caption_file, image_file, jwplayer_video, and title fields. When using this snippet for the JWPlayer, put a title in the field or else the player will not render.
